# Space-spiders-2.1

I made this game as a part of learning Python by following a tutorial. I used the Pygame library for this purpose. The game has three main parts:
1. Start Menu: It gives instructions about how to use the controls and some action keys.
2. Game Mode: As the name suggests, it is when you play the game.
3. Game Over Menu: This shows the option to play again.

Just run the code & Happy gaming :)

A sneak peek of the game -->
