# Space-spiders-2.1

It was made using the pygame library in Python. It has 3 main modes which are nested in a while loop:
1. The start menu: It gives instructions about how to use the controls and some action keys.
2. Game Mode: As the name suggests, it is when you play the game.
3. Game Over Menu: This shows the option to play again.

Just run the code and happy gaming :)

A small snippet of the game:
